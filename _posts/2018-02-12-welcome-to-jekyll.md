You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
 
cd $ROOT_DIR
DOT_FILES="lastpass weechat ssh Xauthority"
for dotfile in $DOT_FILES; do conform_link "$DATA_DIR/$dotfile" ".$dotfile"; done
 
# TODO: refactor with suffix variables (or common cron values)
 
case "$PLATFORM" in
    linux)
        #conform_link "$CONF_DIR/shell/zshenv" ".zshenv"
        crontab -l > $ROOT_DIR/tmp/crontab-conflict-arch
        cd $ROOT_DIR/$CONF_DIR/cron
        if [[ "$(diff ~/tmp/crontab-conflict-arch crontab-current-arch)" == ""
            ]];
            then # no difference with current backup
                logger "$LOG_PREFIX: crontab live settings match stored "\
                    "settings; no restore required"
                rm ~/tmp/crontab-conflict-arch
            else # current crontab settings in file do not match live settings
                crontab $ROOT_DIR/$CONF_DIR/cron/crontab-current-arch
                logger "$LOG_PREFIX: crontab stored settings conflict with "\
                    "live settings; stored settings restored. "\
                    "Previous settings recorded in ~/tmp/crontab-conflict-arch."
        fi
    ;;
```
